Code Book for Tidy UCI HAR Dataset
The tidy data in tidy_dataset.txt can be read into R with the following code:
    read.table("tidy_dataset.txt", header = TRUE, colClasses=c('factor','factor', rep('numeric',66)))
Definition:  The UCI HAR Dataset (University of California Irvine’s dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set) was the data used to create the tidy_dataset.txt.  The source data is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
tidy_dataset.txt includes the combined test and training data sets.  README.md lists the process for cleaning and creating the tidy_dataset.txt.
The run_analysis.R script generates a combined subset of the original data by extracting the mean and standard deviation features for each of the 33 processed signals for a total of 66 features.  The combined subset contains 10299 observations of 68 variables with activity and subject appended to the 66 features.  This subset is further reduced by calculating the mean of the observations by activity and subject pair.
Study Design:  The original data was collected from 30 volunteers age 19 to 48 that performed six activities while carrying a waist-mounted Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone with an inertial sensor.  The six activities included walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and lying. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Time-Series

Description of Variables:
The original data set includes the following files:
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A
